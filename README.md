Here is the list of project requirements per my professor:

Using the code provided with the homework, and the pygame python library, continue
working on the client-server application of the “bucket catch” game.


2. The objective of the game is to collect as many falling objects as possible, similar to the
“bucket catch” game.

4. Rules of the game:
a. One bucket moves sideways (even up and down) to collect all falling objects.
b. Falling objects must be generated at random locations from the top of the screen
from the starting position on the X-axis.
c. Objects will fall faster as the game progresses.
d. Bucket also moves faster as the game progresses.
e. Player losses as soon as the first object touches the bottom of the screen.


6. A score must be displayed on the screen. No leaderboard is necessary.

   
8. GUI is not an important part of the homework, it is not necessary to implement any
visual elements outside of the basic elements to execute the game properly.


10. The server side will be in charge of displaying the game while the client side will be in
charge of the controls, you can set the controls to be with any keys from the keyboard,
preferable with the “WASD” or arrow keys.

12. Homework can be developed in pairs of two students, allowing for 2 people to work on
the 2 people’s project made specifically for 2 people and no less or more than 2 people.


14. The project will be evaluated during class time by the instructor and the grader together.
With students running the server and client side on two separate computers.

16. Project must be submitted to canvas as a .rar or .zip file containing all the source codes.


In order to run the program fork the repository to your local machine.
- Open repository on your local machine in your prefered IDE
- enter the current ip address of your machine into the "host" variable on the GameClient.py
- Split terminal
- run the command python3 GameServer.py for the server side terminal
- run the command python3 GameClient.py on the client side terminal
